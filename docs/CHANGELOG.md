# Changelog

## 2026-05-18 (frontend live transcript duplicate fix)
- User-visible:
  - Removed accumulated live partial rows from the transcript history; the pane now shows final rows plus one current `LIVE` preview.
  - Stopping or reconnecting clears stale live preview text.
- Internal:
  - Frontend keeps live partials out of the committed transcript row list.
  - Backend no longer starts audio meter capture loops before transcription is running.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Open the app without pressing Start and confirm transcript text does not begin updating.
  - Run transcription and confirm older live partial guesses do not accumulate as transcript rows.

## 2026-05-18 (transcript duplicate suppression)
- User-visible:
  - Reworked final transcript emission to avoid both shifted-timestamp duplicates and missing finalized rows from rolling-window STT.
  - Suppressed near-immediate repeated final transcript rows while preserving short repeated utterances.
- Internal:
  - STT finalization now diffs each rolling decoded final window against recently committed words and emits only the new suffix.
  - `TranscriptStore.add_segment` now returns whether a segment was accepted and filters recent same-source duplicate text of at least three words before storage/broadcast.
  - Added focused backend unit tests for STT final-text diffing and transcript duplicate suppression.
- How to test:
  - `cd backend && python -m unittest discover -s tests`
  - `python -m compileall backend/app backend/tests`

## 2026-05-18 (denser frontend spacing)
- User-visible:
  - Reduced the overall interface footprint by halving nonzero CSS padding values and lowering the root font size.
- Internal:
  - Centralized the text scale change through the root `html` font size in `frontend/src/styles.css`.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Open the Desk and Settings pages and confirm controls, tables, transcript rows, and response content render more compactly.

## 2026-03-10 (desk pane order: response left)
- User-visible:
  - Swapped the main desk panes so `Response` appears on the left and `Transcript` on the right.
- Internal:
  - Reordered the desk page pane rendering in the main app layout.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Open the desk page and confirm `Response` is the left column on desktop widths.

## 2026-03-10 (answer-action custom-instruction + split top controls)
- User-visible:
  - The inline `Answer` button now uses the custom instruction when one is filled in; otherwise it falls back to `Answer the question`.
  - The top desk controls are now split into stacked vertical `Audio` and `AI` blocks.
  - Removed the extra `Audio`/`AI` helper copy above those controls, and placed `Input mode` beside the audio-mode switch.
- Internal:
  - Added a dedicated `runAnswer` flow in the renderer rather than routing the inline answer action through the generic preset handler.
  - Refactored prompt-bar layout/CSS into two grouped panels for clearer control separation.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Enter a custom instruction, click `Answer`, and confirm the backend request uses `customInstruction`.
  - Clear the custom instruction, click `Answer`, and confirm it behaves like the built-in answer preset.
  - Verify the top controls render as stacked vertical `Audio` and `AI` blocks.

## 2026-03-10 (cpu-safe stt defaults for local runs)
- User-visible:
  - Fixed local transcription startup on non-CUDA machines by defaulting STT to CPU-safe settings instead of trying to load `libcublas.so.12`.
- Internal:
  - Changed backend STT defaults from `cuda/float16` to `cpu/int8`.
  - Updated backend setup docs and env example to reflect CPU-first local development.
- How to test:
  - Remove any `STT_DEVICE=cuda` override from `backend/.env.local` or set `STT_DEVICE=cpu`.
  - `./scripts/dev.sh start`
  - Start transcription and confirm the backend no longer emits `libcublas.so.12` errors.

## 2026-03-10 (vite react preamble black-screen fix)
- User-visible:

- Internal:
  - Replaced the static renderer CSP meta tag with a build-only CSP injected by Vite.
  - Electron main process now skips CSP enforcement in local dev and only applies the stricter policy for packaged/prod loads.
- How to test:
  - `./scripts/dev.sh stop`
  - `./scripts/dev.sh start`
  - Confirm the Electron window renders instead of staying black and the DevTools console no longer shows the preamble error.

  - Ask a question tied to that document and confirm query runs with RAG notice.

## 2026-02-25 (prod renderer blank-screen fix)
- User-visible:
  - Fixed `./scripts/prod.sh start` showing a black frontend window in production mode.
- Internal:
  - Set Vite `base: './'` so production `dist/index.html` uses relative asset URLs (`./assets/...`) compatible with Electron `loadFile(...)`.
  - Keeps CSP hardening in place while restoring packaged renderer asset loading.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - `./scripts/prod.sh stop`

- Internal:
  - Added an explicit CSP header in Electron main process via `session.defaultSession.webRequest.onHeadersReceived`.
  - Added matching CSP meta tag to `frontend/index.html` for packaged file loads.
  - CSP disallows `unsafe-eval` and constrains script/object/frame sources while keeping required WS/HTTP connectivity.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - `cd frontend && npm run dev`
  - Open Electron DevTools console and confirm the CSP warning no longer appears.

## 2026-02-24 (inline answer action + smaller response text)
- User-visible:
  - Added an `Answer` button in the selected-text editor header (same row as `Reset to selection`) so you can run the preset answer without scrolling to top controls.
  - Response text rendering is now 40% smaller.
- Internal:
  - Output pane now accepts `onAnswer`/`canAnswer` handlers and wires the new button to the existing preset-run path.
  - Added `selected-text-editor-actions` layout styles and reduced `.output-body pre` font size.

## 2026-02-24 (query input integrity: draft text + screenshot inclusion)
- User-visible:
  - Fixed a bug where manually edited selected text could be overwritten by stale transcript selection updates before sending a query.
  - Capturing a screenshot now automatically enables screenshot inclusion for the next query.
  - Clearing screenshot preview now disables screenshot inclusion to avoid sending empty screenshot flags.
- Internal:
  - Added selection-key and draft-edit guards in frontend query input flow so repeated `selectionchange` events do not clobber user edits.
  - Updated screenshot capture/clear handlers to keep `includeScreenshotInQuery` synchronized with preview state.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Select transcript text, edit it manually, then run preset/custom while transcript updates continue; verify sent answer follows edited text.
  - Capture screen and run query; verify response meta shows `Screenshot sent: yes`.

## 2026-02-24 (env example updates for STT tuning)
- User-visible:
  - Added missing STT language and silence-guard variables to `backend/.env.example`.
- Internal:

- How to test:
  - Open `backend/.env.example` and verify the new STT variables are listed.

## 2026-02-24 (silence hallucination guard for STT)
- User-visible:
  - Reduced false transcript rows on silence (for example repeated `You` while audio meter is effectively zero).
- Internal:
  - Added `STT_MIN_DECODE_RMS` silence gate to skip partial/final decoding on very low-energy windows.
  - Added `STT_NO_VAD_FALLBACK_MIN_RMS` so no-VAD fallback is only used when audio energy is high enough.
  - Whisper decode now uses `condition_on_previous_text=False` to reduce repetition loops on low-information audio.
- How to test:
  - `python -m compileall backend/app`
  - Start transcription in a quiet room/system silence and verify repeated fake rows no longer appear.
  - If speech gets clipped on very quiet input, lower `STT_MIN_DECODE_RMS` slightly (for example `0.0007`).

## 2026-02-24 (mic startup source fallback + recording indicator)
- User-visible:
  - Fixed a startup issue where microphone mode could fail to transcribe until switching modes.
  - Added a blinking red dot near the active volume meter while transcription is running.
- Internal:
  - Backend now validates requested monitor/mic sources against currently available sources and auto-falls back to valid defaults when saved source names are stale.
  - Source validation is applied both in `audio_sources` broadcasts and `start_transcription`.
  - Prompt bar meter labels now render per-mode recording activity dots with a blink animation.
- How to test:
  - `python -m compileall backend/app`
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Launch in mic mode and press `Start`; verify mic transcribes immediately without requiring mode toggles.
  - While transcribing, verify the active mode meter shows a blinking red dot.

## 2026-02-24 (mic language-hint stabilization)
- User-visible:
  - Microphone transcription is now more stable for accented English by default, reducing random language switches between rows.
  - Running transcription status now shows the active STT language mode (`language: en` or `language: auto`).
- Internal:
  - Added mode-specific STT language hints:
    - `STT_MIC_LANGUAGE` (default `en`)
    - `STT_SYSTEM_LANGUAGE` (default auto)
    - `STT_LANGUAGE` (global fallback)
  - Faster-whisper transcribe calls now pass configured language hints and keep the setting in sync when switching system/mic modes.
- How to test:
  - `python -m compileall backend/app`
  - Start app in microphone mode and verify transcript rows no longer bounce across random languages.
  - Optionally set `STT_MIC_LANGUAGE=it` in `backend/.env`, restart backend, and verify mic transcription uses Italian.

## 2026-02-24 (persisted desk preferences + quick input switch)
- User-visible:

- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Launch app, set mode/source/model/preset/custom instruction and screenshot toggle, restart app, and confirm values are preserved.
  - Start transcription and click `Switch to ...`; confirm mode changes and transcript continues updating.

## 2026-02-24 (transcript selection single-line normalization)
- User-visible:
  - Multi-row transcript selections now paste into selected text as one line, with spaces between rows (no per-row line breaks).
- Internal:
  - Selection extraction now inserts row-boundary spaces and normalizes any line feeds to single spaces.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Start the app, select text across several transcript rows, and verify selected text is single-line with readable spaces between row boundaries.

## 2026-02-24 (transcript selection row-spacing fix)
- User-visible:
  - Selecting multiple transcript rows now keeps readable separation between rows instead of collapsing adjacent lines together.
- Internal:
  - Frontend selection extraction now injects row separators before text normalization, preventing `textContent` row-boundary collapse.
  - Selection fallback cleanup now also removes `SYS` and `MIC` source tags when present in raw selection text.
- How to test:
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Start the app, select text spanning 2+ transcript rows, and verify selected text includes spacing/newline boundaries (for example no `...?next...` concatenation).

  - Audio level bars now react faster and with finer resolution (less “stale” jump behavior).
  - Audio level bars now work even before pressing `Start`, so input routing can be debugged without running transcription.
- Internal:
  - Backend meter emission cadence increased and now emits immediately on significant level jumps.
  - Meter level now uses combined RMS + peak-derived scaling to improve attack responsiveness.
  - Backend now runs dedicated always-on meter capture loops for system and mic sources, separate from STT capture.

- Internal:
  - Backend benchmark payload now includes `ttcMs` on attempts and `avgTtcMs|minTtcMs|maxTtcMs` plus `aggregateScore` on result rows.
  - Added a speed-first aggregate scoring formula (heavy TTC/TTFT weighting, with reliability and quality penalties).
  - Frontend latest/history/live benchmark tables now read TTC fields directly and render aggregate score.
- How to test:
  - `python -m compileall backend/app`
  - `cd frontend && npm run build`
  - Run a benchmark and verify TTC + Agg Score columns populate in Settings tables.
